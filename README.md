# 🔥 Fire Sentinel STM – A Smart Fire-Fighting Robot Using STM32

> A low-cost, autonomous, and intelligent fire-fighting robot developed as part of the Electronics Systems Design (ESD) project at IIIT-Delhi.

## 🚨 Overview

**Fire Sentinel STM** is an autonomous robotic system designed to detect and suppress fire using real-time embedded systems. Built on the STM32 Nucleo platform, this robot integrates flame sensors, brushless motors, and a servo-controlled water pump to autonomously identify fire sources and extinguish them.

## ⚙️ Features

- **Real-Time Fire Detection**  
  Directional flame sensing using an array of flame sensors.

- **Autonomous Navigation**  
  Controlled by brushless DC motors for smart movement towards the fire source.

- **Targeted Suppression**  
  Water pump and servo mechanism for directional fire extinguishing.

- **Embedded Control**  
  Complete control system built using STM32 Nucleo and STM32CubeIDE with HAL drivers.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Microcontroller**: STM32 Nucleo Board  
- **IDE**: STM32CubeIDE  
- **Firmware**: HAL Drivers
